 aue_flavor.1.t: "The margraviates of Romania and Bulgaria"
 aue_flavor.1.d: "With the conquest of the terretories of Bulgaria, Moldavia and Wallachia, we now have to decide how those land should be governed. We can of course govern the land themselves, and force our direct rule upon the people or give the land autonomy under our vassalge."
 aue_flavor.1.a: "We will govern ourselves."
 aue_flavor.1.b: "The land will be given autonomy and serve us in war."
 aue_flavor.2.t: "Government of Europe"
 aue_flavor.2.d: "The formation of the European Union is without question the mark of a new era approching. However, our government is still divided on how the Union should be governed. We can keep our monarchy to rule with an enlightended ruler dignified by God at the head of the government, or we could answer the calls of the people, placing an elected ruler at the top, legitimized not by god, but by the very people he rules."
 aue_flavor.2.a: "A strong ruler, anaffected by the squabling rabble, shall rule us!"
 aue_flavor.2.b: "From the people for the people!"
 aue_flavor.2.c: "Proclaim the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as a holy monarch."
 aue_flavor.3.t: "The question of the capital"
 aue_flavor.3.d: "Now it comes to the question of where to place our center of rule. Multiple cities seem to be a prestigious option. The capitals of old empires and kingdoms. Or maybe we should choose new location, free from the influence of history, to forge our own destiny to signify this new era of a united Europe."
 aue_flavor.3.a: "Brussels. No city with a great history, but a central location."
 aue_flavor.3.b: "Rome. The eternal city of the great Roman Empire, which once unified vast areas of Europe."
 aue_flavor.3.c: "Vienna. The long time capital of the Holy Roman Empire and a central location in Europe."
 aue_flavor.3.e: "Paris. The capital of the French. Legacy of Charlemagne."
 aue_flavor.3.f: "We will keep our capital. We will forge our destiny, from where it started."
 aue_incest.1.t: "Incestous Realtions"
 aue_incest.1.d: "The bed of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been empty for quite some time and no suitor from other families could be found. But rumors have been circulating, that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has taken a liking to one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cousins.\nShould we encourage this behaviour? Incestous relations between ruling families have often been attributed to better offspring, although many would contest such claims. While such a \"divine marriage\" might not be very popular with the church, it would increase our chances for an heir. And maybe a pure blooded heir of great strength could result from this, or maybe it will be a sickly little child. Who yould predict it?"
 aue_incest.1.a: "This is preposterous. An affront to all that is good and holy!"
 aue_incest.1.b: "Why not? A pure blooded heir might proof more capable."
